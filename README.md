# VBA stock-analysis

## Objective:
The objective of this assignment was to refactor the code that we created to help our client Steve investigate the performance of certain stocks.  By refactoring the code we are able to deliver a more efficient process for Steve to collect and analyze the data he needs to make financial decisions.

## Results:
By refactoring the code we were able to decrease the time it took to run and format all of the code.  The time for the [2017 original code](https://github.com/kowiak89/stock-analysis/blob/main/Resources/2017%20original%20code.png) and [2017 refactored code](https://github.com/kowiak89/stock-analysis/blob/main/Resources/VBA_Challenge_2017.png) can be seen in these links.  The time for the [2018 original code](https://github.com/kowiak89/stock-analysis/blob/main/Resources/2018%20original%20code.png) and the [2018 refactored code](https://github.com/kowiak89/stock-analysis/blob/main/Resources/VBA_Challenge_2018.png) can be seen in these links.
