# VBA stock-analysis

## Objective:
The objective of this assignment was to refactor the code that we created to help our client Steve investigate the performance of certain stocks.  By refactoring the code we are able to deliver a more efficient process for Steve to collect and analyze the data he needs to make financial decisions.

## Results:
### Original Code vs Refactored Code:
By refactoring the code we were able to decrease the time it took to run and format all of the code.  The time for the [2017 original code](https://github.com/kowiak89/stock-analysis/blob/main/Resources/2017%20original%20code.png) and the [2017 refactored code](https://github.com/kowiak89/stock-analysis/blob/main/Resources/VBA_Challenge_2017.png) can be seen in these links.  The time for the [2018 original code](https://github.com/kowiak89/stock-analysis/blob/main/Resources/2018%20original%20code.png) and the [2018 refactored code](https://github.com/kowiak89/stock-analysis/blob/main/Resources/VBA_Challenge_2018.png) can be seen in these links.

From these screen shots we can show that our refactored code outpreformed the original code by approxiamately 0.1 seconds.  This decrease in time may seem small, but was achievable on a fairly small scale when comparing this data set to the entire stock market.  As the data set scales up in size we can be confident that the time gap between the original code and refactored code will widen.

### Overall Stock Preformance:
Using the code that we wrote, we are able to analyze the stock data and draw conslusions about individual stock performances for each year.  The excel spreadsheet contains this data in the Performance tab.  In 2017 the stock with the largest return was DQ with a total return of 199.4%, and the smallest return was TERP with a total return of -7.2%.  (things were looking good for Steve's parents in 2017). In 2018 the market shifted and the top gainer was RUN with a total return of 84%.  The stock with the smallest return in 2018 was DQ with a total return of -62.6%.

While knowing the highest and lowest performing stocks in a given year is useful information, most investors want longer term data.  If we were to assume that Steve's parents held the shares of DQ from the start of 2017 until the end of 2018 we can see that they were still profitable at a total return of 17.9%.  This longer return is able to show an investor the value of their current investment, rather than where it was a a specific point in time in the past.  A table showing the return from 2017 - 2018 can be found in the performance tab in the excel spreadsheet.

## Summary:
### Advantages vs Disadvantages of refactored code:
### Advantages:
Some advanteges of refactoring code is that it allows you to improve upon the current code.  We were able to show this by timing the time it took the computer to complete the original code and refactored code.  By making the code more efficient, we are able to save time in the real world when data sets can get much larger.  Another advantage is that it allows the person refactoring the code more insight into what the original code is trying to do.  During this module, I became much more aware of what each part of the code was doing when I went through it a second time.

### Disadvantages:
A disadvantage to refactoring code might be that the original code is already efficient and trying to refactor it might make it worse.  It could make it more complicated or make the computer take longer to run it.  I did not come across this disadvantage in this assignment, but I am confident I will see it at some point in my experience.
